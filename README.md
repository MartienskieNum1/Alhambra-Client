# Alhambra web project (Client)

This application forms the frontend of my school project
with as objective to make a web application out of the board game Alhambra.

For the backend, Java is used. The frontend uses HTML, CSS and JS.

# Launch

To be able to use this application, you firstly need to run the Alhambra Server.
Refer to the README in my [Alhambra-Server](https://github.com/MartienskieNum1/Alhambra-Server)
repo to read how.

Then open `index.html` and you're ready to go.

By opening this file a second time in another browser,
you can play together with a friend.

Game rules can be found in the application.
